# Final Year Project: AI-Enhanced Student Skills Development Tracker
 
Project Introduction

In contemporary education, the development of student skills is crucial, particularly in areas such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. Standard approaches such as the use of tests and assignment results are limited in their ability to measure the changes in students over these diverse skill areas. All these methods do not give a holistic picture of students’ progress in the competencies. Due to the continued development of artificial intelligence (AI) in the recent past, the education sector is steadily adopting AI solutions for purposes of improving the assessment of student skills. 
The AI-Enhanced Student Skills Development Tracker is designed to offer students’ performance analysis and recommendations for further improvement based on the data about students’ learning behavior, results of the assignments, and activity in the class. This system is to provide timely feedback on students’ learning of critical thinking, problem solving and collaboration, so that both students and teachers will be able to improve these skills incrementally.
